MG_OMP
======

OpenMP enabled PDE solver for 1D, 2D and 3D PDEs of either hyperbolic, parabolic or elliptic character. Uses Jacobi iteration to reduce residuals so the residual equations you supply should be diagonally dominant. 

Four sample programs are included which solve the 1D nonlinear Poisson equation, 3D nonlinear Poisson equation, Schrodinger equation on a line and Schrodinger-Newton equation in spherical symmetry.
